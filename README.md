## Assignment of software engineering

I did **angular.js** in PSP assignment.
So this time I wanna try something new to me.
After learning the basic of angular and other javascript framework
I picked up **vuejs** as my tool to do this assignment.
It was quite easy to understand and learn.
It also has two way data binding like angular which I feel awesome.
And it doesn't enforce you to use typescript like angular2.
